  "summary": "The diff focuses on adding a build identifier utility, updating the Layout navigation (including mobile sheet navigation) and updating the deployment smoke-check document. It does not provide evidence of actually fully publishing Draft Version 12 or of performing the post-publish manual verification on the published URL.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Fully publish the currently deployed draft (Draft Version 12) so the latest frontend and backend changes are live (not just a draft deployment).",
      "reason": "The diff shows only source/code/documentation changes and contains no evidence of a production publication/go-live action (e.g., deploy config changes, release scripts, CI/CD changes, or any other publishing mechanism) nor any evidence that the published URL now serves the latest version.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary shows only: frontend/src/utils/buildInfo.ts, frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx, frontend/DEPLOYMENT_SMOKE_CHECK.md, frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "After publication succeeds, manually verify the published build using the existing checklist in frontend/DEPLOYMENT_SMOKE_CHECK.md, ensuring routes load and Dashboard is reachable via navigation on desktop and mobile.",
      "reason": "The diff includes updates to the checklist and navigation code, but does not provide evidence that post-publish verification was actually performed on a published deployment (no recorded results, logs, screenshots, or other proof of manual verification).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/DEPLOYMENT_SMOKE_CHECK.md",
        "frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx"

    {
      "description": "Added a build identifier utility (build timestamp/version environment variable reading) for display/verification.",
      "reason": "REQ-25/REQ-26 request publishing and manual verification using an existing checklist; they do not explicitly request adding new build metadata utilities or UI elements for build identification.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/utils/buildInfo.ts",
        "frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx (imports getBuildIdentifier)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Modified the deployment smoke-check checklist to include a 'Build Verification' step referencing a footer build identifier format.",
      "reason": "REQ-26 asks to use the existing checklist in frontend/DEPLOYMENT_SMOKE_CHECK.md for verification; the diff shows edits/expansion to that checklist rather than only executing it.",
