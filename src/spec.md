# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fully publish Draft Version 12 so the latest frontend and backend changes are live, then verify the published build via the existing smoke check checklist.

**Planned changes:**
- Promote the currently deployed draft (Draft Version 12) to a fully published/go-live deployment.
- Run the manual post-publish smoke check using `frontend/DEPLOYMENT_SMOKE_CHECK.md`, confirming core routes load and the Reader Dashboard is reachable at `/dashboard` and via primary navigation on desktop and mobile.

**User-visible outcome:** The live published app serves the latest build, and users can successfully access `/`, `/tracker`, and `/dashboard`, including reaching the Dashboard from the site navigation on both desktop and mobile.
